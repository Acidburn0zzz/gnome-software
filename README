For GNOME 3.10:
 * Aim for feature parity with gnome-packagekit
 * Focus on update experience
 * Always update offline (including security updates)
 * Never wait on downloads in the application
 * Search for available applications
 * May not have screenshots, ratings and other metadata for the installation part
 * The only metadata we absolutely want to have is icons
